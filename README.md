_Number_Place_Breaker_for_Android_

Number Place Breaker is an Android app that automatically solves a Number Place (also known as _Sudoku_ or 数独) puzzle.  It is a sort of apps usually called _Sudoku_Solver_.  However, unlike most of other sudoku solvers, you don't need to type in a puzzle.  Use your phone's camera to take a picture of a puzzle, and touch the [Solve] button.  That's all.  The solution to the puzzle then appears on the screen.  It takes several seconds, but that's surely faster than you, isn't it?

The ready to use apk should be available [here on Google Play] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.at.sabre.alissa.numberplace).

Note that this app has no practical usages.  Please consider it as an experiment, a proof of concept, or a technology demonstration.

What's inside
-------------

Number Place Breaker heavily depends on the following two third party technologies:

* It uses [OpenCV] (http://opencv.org) (more precisely, OpenCV4Android) to recognize the puzzle, and
* It uses [SAT4J] (http://www.sat4j.org) to solve the puzzle.

You can consider this app as a sample program of one of them.

The source code is available at https://github.com/AlissaSabre/NumberPlace (in case you are reading this on anywhere else.)

Other notes
-----------

If you don't know what is Number Place or Sudoku, well, it's an addictive puzzle. You can visit [Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), or you will find a lot of web sites that explain it by a simple search.

I wrote this app after reading [this excellent article] (http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/copris/puzzles/sudoku/index.html) by Naoyuki Tamura.
